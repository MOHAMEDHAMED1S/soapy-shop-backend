            {

            }
        ]
    }

        },
        "growth_metrics": {...},
        "seasonal_trends": [...]
    }
}
```

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Column Mapping Issues
- **Problem**: Queries were using incorrect column names (`total` instead of `total_amount`, `price` instead of `product_price`, etc.)
- **Solution**: Updated all queries to use correct column names from the database schema

### 2. GROUP BY Clause Issues
- **Problem**: MySQL strict mode requires all selected columns to be in GROUP BY clause
- **Solution**: Added all selected columns to GROUP BY clauses or limited SELECT to only grouped columns

### 3. Payment Status Filtering
- **Problem**: Queries were looking for `payment_status` column in orders table
- **Solution**: Used `whereHas` relationship with payments table to filter by payment status

### 4. JSON Field Extraction
- **Problem**: Queries were trying to access `city` as a direct column
- **Solution**: Used `JSON_EXTRACT` to get city from the JSON address field

### 5. Method Visibility
- **Problem**: `getSeasonalTrends` was private and couldn't be called as an endpoint
- **Solution**: Converted to public method with proper request handling and JSON response

## Performance Notes
- All queries execute successfully without timeout issues
- Empty result sets return proper JSON structure with empty arrays
- Error handling is implemented for all endpoints with try-catch blocks

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding database indexes on frequently queried columns (`created_at`, `customer_id`, etc.)
2. Implement caching for expensive analytical queries
3. Add pagination for large result sets
4. Consider using database views for complex analytical queries

## Test Data Availability
- Current test data shows orders primarily in October 2025
- Limited data in the specified test range (2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31) results in mostly empty arrays
- All endpoints handle empty data gracefully and return proper JSON structure
